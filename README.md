#Electronics Store

This web app is a fake online store where users can view, rate, and purchase various electronics.

It is made with AngularJS, Bootstrap, Spring REST, Spring JDBC, and H2 Embedded SQL Database.


To start server, cd to the top level, and run the following command:

gradlew.bat appRunWar		(Windows)

./gradlew appRunWar 		(Linux/Mac)


Very much still a work in progress...
